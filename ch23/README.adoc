== Non Distributed

I use `ThymeLeaf`.

=== Problems
==== RenderAction

I don't know the exact replacement for `RenderAction`.

----
@{ Html.RenderAction("ItemInBasket", "CatalogBoundedContext", new { productId = pid}); }
----

`ThymeLeaf` can insert fragment of HTML. But I couldn't figure out how to pass data there.
[source, html]
----
<!-- inserts fragment.html -->
<div th:insert="~{/fragment}"></div>
----

My workaround is to explicitly call Java code.

----
<div th:remove="tag" th:utext="${@CatalogBoundedContextController.itemInBasket(pid)}"></div>
----

=== Result Run
I replaced the image and use a local one instead of going to the internet.
