== RavenDB

I ran `RavenDB` from docker. I need to  manually create a database.

[source,yaml]
----
include::assets/docker-compose.yaml[tags=header;ravendb]

== SQLite

=== Problems

==== Jackson `LocalDateTime` support
The exception:
----
Caused by: com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.exc.InvalidDefinitionException: Java 8 date/time type `java.time.LocalDateTime` not supported by default: add Module "com.fasterxml.jackson.datatype:jackson-datatype-jsr310" to enable handling (through reference chain: sqliteeventstore.model.PayAsYouGo.PhoneCallCharged["phoneCall"]->sqliteeventstore.model.PayAsYouGo.PhoneCall["callStart"])
----

Fixed by registering the module.
----
objectMapper.registerModule(new JavaTimeModule());
----

==== Jackson tries tp deserialize Domain methods

In `PhoneNumber`, Jackson tried to deserialize boolean checks e.g. `isUKLandlineOrMobile`.
However, it's not a field.
Adding `JsonIgnore` solves the problem.
But it brings a bit of infrastructure into the model.

==== Jackson serialization/deserialization

Jackson needs no-arg constructors, getters and setters.
Which makes classes a bit of boilerplate-ish.

==== Maintaining versions

`RavenDB` works as `UnitOfWork` and tracks changes of aggregates.
Here I don't use `UnitOfWork` pattern, that's why I "manually" update `event_sources` table.
See `EventStore.appendEventsToStream`.

=== Schema

I use `SQLite`, the schema is below.

[source,sql]
----
include::assets/sqlite/schema.sql[]
----

=== Screenshots

Screenshots from the application run.
There are almost the same as for `RavenDB`.
I keep them just to demonstrate that the application works.

----

== EventStoreDB
By default `EventStoreDB` is non-blocking. Each call returns `CompletableFuture`.
I used "blocking" calls. To achieve that, I added a helper method that waits for completions.
See `EventStoreD.await`.

I run `EventStoreDB` from docker.
[source,yaml]
----
include::assets/docker-compose.yaml[tags=header;eventstoredb]
----

=== Problems

==== Integer Overloading

In `EventStore.getStream`, we calculate `amount`.
It can lead to integer overload.

[source,java]
----
@Override public List<DomainEvent> getStream(String streamName, int fromVersion, int toVersion) {
  // if fromVersion = 0, toVersion = Integer.MAX_VALUE
  // we have interger overload
  var amount = (toVersion - fromVersion) + 1;
}
----

==== Getting the end of a stream
`ReadStreamOptions.get().fromEnd()` leads to the exception below.

.exception
----
java.lang.RuntimeException: java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException: io.grpc.StatusRuntimeException: UNKNOWN: Unexpected ReadStreamResult: Error
----

`ReadStreamOptions.get().fromEnd().backwards()` works.

==== Different ObjectMappers
`EventStoreDB` creates `ObjectMapper` ad hoc, that's why I can't even register a module.

.com.eventstore.dbclient.EventDataBuilder
[source, java]
----
public static <A> EventDataBuilder json(UUID id, String eventType, A eventData) {
    try {
        JsonMapper mapper = new JsonMapper(); // <--- HERE
        return json(id, eventType, mapper.writeValueAsBytes(eventData));
    } catch (JsonProcessingException e) {
        throw new RuntimeException(e);
    }
}
----

E.g. I can't use `LocalDateTime`, because this mapper doesn't have `jackson-datatype-jsr310` module.
And I can't add it.

.I can't register module
----
Caused by: com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.exc.InvalidDefinitionException: Java 8 date/time type `java.time.LocalDateTime` not supported by default: add Module "com.fasterxml.jackson.datatype:jackson-datatype-jsr310" to enable handling (through reference chain: sqliteeventstore.model.PayAsYouGo.PhoneCallCharged["phoneCall"]->sqliteeventstore.model.PayAsYouGo.PhoneCall["callStart"])
----

I switched `LocalDateTime` to `String`.

When we save, we serialize data with `ObjectMapper`, that "embedded" into `EventStoreDB`.
When we load, we deserialize data with own `ObjectMapper`. Data is serialized and deserialized by different `ObjectMapper`.
It's not good.

=== Screenshots

We start from a clean `EventStoreDB`.

.clean eventstore
image::assets/eventstoredb/clean-es.png[]

Then we create a steam  and the first event

.AccountCreated event data

.PhoneCallCharged event
image::assets/eventstoredb/PhoneCallCharged1.png[]
.PhoneCallCharged event data
image::assets/eventstoredb/PhoneCallCharged1-data.png[]

Top up account leads to two events: `CreditSatisfiesFreeCallAllowanceOffer` and `CreditAdded`.

.top up account
image::assets/eventstoredb/AccountTopUp.png[]
.CreditSatisfiesFreeCallAllowanceOffer event data
image::assets/eventstoredb/CreditSatisfiesFreeCallAllowanceOffer.png[]
.CreditAdded event data

The last phone call

.PhoneCallCharged event
image::assets/eventstoredb/PhoneCallCharged2.png[]
.PhoneCallCharged event data
image::assets/eventstoredb/PhoneCallCharged2-data.png[]


=== Result Run
See `ESDBProgram`. But in logs, there is nothing interesting. Most interesting is screenshots.

== Running Queries on EventStoreDB

I do it on empty `EventStoreDB`.
To populate data in `EventStoreDB`, run `ImportTestData`.

=== Problems
==== Money Calculations
I was getting `MoreThanTwoDecimalPlacesInMoneyValueException` while importing data.
I think it's because numbers in `ImportTestData` and because of usage of `double`.
To save time, I deleted this check.

==== Inheritance
`FreePhoneCallCosting` extends `PhoneCallCosting`.
`PhoneCallCosting` was a `record` but to make this inheritance I converted it to `class`.

==== Querying categories
Queries `fromCategory` didn't return anything at all.
I found a similar problem on https://stackoverflow.com/a/47535755/4337151[StackOverflow].
I went to: Projections -> `$by_category` -> Press "Start". It helped.

==== Emit is not allowed
It wasn't clear how to create projections. I was getting the
----
'emit' is not allowed by the projection/configuration/mode
----
error message many times. Eventually I figured out. See screenshots in the chapters below.

==== Create a Projection

Go to Projections -> New Projection.

.projection query
[source, javascript]
----
fromCategory('{PayAsYouGoAccount}')
.when({
    "eventstoredb.model.PayAsYouGo.CreditAdded": function(s, event) {
        linkTo('AllTopUps', event);
    }
});
----

.create projection UI
image::assets/eventstoredb/queries/create-projection.png[]

After pressing "Create", you will be redirected to projection details page.

.projection details
image::assets/eventstoredb/queries/projection-details.png[]


you can also see the projection in streams

.our projection
image::assets/eventstoredb/queries/projection-in-streams.png[]

we can explore the projection.

.projection is a stream
image::assets/eventstoredb/queries/projection-is-a-stream.png[]

.projection event data
image::assets/eventstoredb/queries/projection-event-data.png[]


And we can query projections

.query from projection
[source, javascript]
----
fromStream('$projections-AllTopUps')
.when({
     $init : function(state, event) {
        return {
            count: 0
        };
    },
    $any: function(state, event) {
        state.count += 1;
    }
});
